Welcome to ReadySetPrep!
========================

ReadySetPrep!™ is an exam preparation app that uses its own study points to identify weak knowledge areas and provide a targeted learning plan for review and improvement.

This repository contains all code for the managed package. 

ReadySetPrep is Copyright © 2012 Ted Husted. 

The source code for the app is available via the BSD license. Contributions welcome. Contact ReadySetPrep at Husted dot Com or submit a pull request for details. 

Note: Significant contributions may require completing a (practically painless) Contributor's License Agreement. 

A subscription version of the app is being made avalable through the AppExchange and automatically updated as improvements are made. Developers may also install the app from source code directly from this site and avoid the subscription fee. 

Review Modules for the various certification and maintenance exams can be downloaded from this site in CSV format, via the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, and imported into a subscriber org using the Apex DataLoader or Custom Object Wizard. 

See the wiki for a [complete listing of available review modules](https://github.com/ReadySetPrep/force.com/wiki/Review-Modules).
